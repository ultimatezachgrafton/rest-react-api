<b>Summary</b><br>
It turns out I'd grown a bit too comfortable with my code-writing skills. But not to worry, React took care of that. And this time he brought REST for backup. These huge curveballs really pushed me to make sure I really knew the fundamentals. I took a step back and made sure I was rock steady with setting up my projects and establishing the appropriate dev environments. Then I made sure to take plenty of time to learn the basics of REST, and reinforce my understanding of React. The result is this mighty app you see before you!
